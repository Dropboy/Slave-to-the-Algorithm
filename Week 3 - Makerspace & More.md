# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 3

__*Makerspace Visit & Processing tutorials*__

To start the session we had a quick chat about potential 3D outcomes for our final projects, which led into the makerspace talk and small visit we had. The makerspace visit helped me understand a little further the potential my project idea has when applied in a 3D space, using a 3D printer or laser engraver would add another dimension to the design, enabling an audience to understand and picture the idea that I have much better than just on a screen.

Also did some processing work on registering an image that is imported and building the image by generating pointillism art
