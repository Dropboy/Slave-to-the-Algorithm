# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 3

__*Makerspace Visit & Processing tutorials*__

To start the session we had a quick chat about potential 3D outcomes for our final projects, which led into the makerspace talk and small visit we had. The makerspace visit helped me understand a little further the potential my project idea has when applied in a 3D space, using a 3D printer or laser engraver would add another dimension to the design, enabling an audience to understand and picture the idea that I have much better than just on a screen.

This talk spurred the furthering of my final project ideas, one extension I thought about was using my original park generation idea, however finding a way to download these 3D generated parks into a 3D format such as .STL, and then using that in a 3D printer. This would give the audience a real view of the park that they are able to handle and manipulate, giving them a better picture of how my park generation is useful in a smaller space, or as a problem solver to park/urban environment planning.

After our makerspace visit and talk about the various different tactile outcomes we could have, we started some work on a processing sketch that would be able to recreate an image that we chose, except generate different sized ellipses as the pixels. These ellipses change in size depending on where the mouse cursor is placed, however it can be edited to have randomly or depending on a lot of different conditions, however using the mouseX and Y coordinates enables you to change the style of the drawing from detailed to blurry on the fly depending on your choice. We also began to play with the frameRate function, when changing it up it made the ellipses generate at a much faster pace, however we were unable to come up with a solid conclusion as to what the frameRate max was, so past a certain point there was minimal change to the speed, this is likely bound to the processing power of all our laptops more than the limitations of processing itself.

This is an interesting way of making an image and creates a textured effect due to the transparency and different size of the ellipses. In class Karen created a similar image generating sketch however with lines instead, which I liked the look of a lot more, due to the different texture it gave and the final image having a lot more of a filtered look to it.
