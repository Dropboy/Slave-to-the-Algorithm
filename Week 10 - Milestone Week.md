# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 10

__*Milestone Week*__

This week my post will be very brief. While in class I worked on creating a Pathway class that would spawn a path that stretches to either side of the platform and is spawned on a random x or z location, however keeps the path size consistent. By the end of the class I had written the display function of the class, and had started at declaring some variables. To display the path at the correct rotation I had to use the inbuilt function rotateX, and rotate that by PI/2. This allowed a rectangle shape that had no fill and a consistent stroke to be laid down flat on the platform, giving the illusion of mildly different textures. This was all that was done in class on my project, as a lot of the session was spent making sure my Github was up to date and my class mates were fairing along well.

After working on my project and chatting with my classmates, my group was called up to present to Karen. I had no problem showing Karen my current work in progress, I have recently started posting all of my code to Github in my Utilised Code Projects folder, this way I always have the updated and current project up online to download. Going forward I will follow the planning guide I outlined in my Week 10 - MILESTONE REVIEW journal, sticking to the required finishing touches, and only experimenting more once I have for sure finished this project. This will be all for this week as there was limited work in class to show, the final journal posts will be fairly short as well, mainly explaining how I will go about adding each feature outlined in my milestone review.
