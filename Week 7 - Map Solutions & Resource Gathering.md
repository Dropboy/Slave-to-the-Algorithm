# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 7

__*Map Solutions & Resource Gathering*__

-Worked on logotype map, made connections between the more human the input is the more connections it will have with other works, the less human the less connections and the more unique the idea

We started the class off by finishing off our logotype map. The final presentations were done and the logotypes were all glued down, this is where the map really started to make sense to our group. We were able to see that some projects worked well together and had similar inputs, meaning they would have a similar method of programming this input, whether it be from an api, or having to write your own code that can then be shared around the class and improved. After we explained how our map worked to the class, the rest of the maps were explained to us, similar to ours everyone's map began to unfold who would effectively work with each-other on certain attributes of the project.

-Also talked about who we could work with for similar resources through the maps

After showing the maps we then started an excel spreadsheet that was able to easier show who could help who. For example, I have found that my project has similar goals as

After going around the classrooms and showing off our collaborative maps, we were then tasked with creating a cardboard mock-up of what we would imagine our programs to look like. I've had a fairly good idea of what I would like my final park presentation to look like for a while, however due to limited time I decided to make a fairly small and basic diorama that was just the basic elements we wanted to show. For example, I have the recursive 2D tree, a small bush I made, and the paths being indicated by some obtruding cardboard. While this is obviously a very different medium to digital 3D art, I want to keep the look fairly faithful to my model. Some things I want to change however are the size and placement of the trees and other fauna. I will also experiment with different sizes of "Parks", changing the scale of the trees and other fauna can utilise a small platform a lot more efficiently and with a decent look to it, however a larger platform will always provide more space to work with, but will not be accurate to the AR room projection I hope to achieve. There will be a lot of experimentation with the size of objects
