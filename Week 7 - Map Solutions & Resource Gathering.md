# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 7

__*Map Solutions & Resource Gathering*__

We started the class off by finishing off our logotype map. The final presentations were done and the logotypes were all glued down, this is where the map really started to make sense to our group. We were able to see that some projects worked well together and had similar inputs, meaning they would have a similar method of programming this input, whether it be from an api, or having to write your own code that can then be shared around the class and improved. After we explained how our map worked to the class, the rest of the maps were explained to us, similar to ours everyone's map began to unfold who would effectively work with each-other on certain attributes of the project.

After showing the maps we then started an excel spreadsheet that was able to easier show who could help who. For example, I have found that my project has similar goals towards the input as: Violet, Crysta, and Liam. All three of these students have very different ideas to mine, when programming the input however they will have a common goal, as we are all using Data as the input. With the rest of my project, for example the output and tools I will need, I will be left a little more to myself. Unfortunately there won't be a lot of people working with Projectors, which will add an element of difficulty when trying to convert my 3D models to a visual AR. This is not necessarily a problem, while I may not have people working on the exact methods and tools I will be, due to the rest of the class researching other methods I will be able to use these projects to have better judgement about whether or not I am going in the right direction and am using the right tools.

We were then tasked with creating a cardboard mock-up of what we would imagine our programs to look like. I've had a fairly good idea of what I would like my final park presentation to look like for a while, however due to limited time I decided to make a fairly small and basic diorama that was just the basic elements we wanted to show. For example, I have the recursive 2D tree, a small bush I made, and the paths being indicated by some obtruding cardboard. While this is obviously a very different medium to digital 3D art, I want to keep the look fairly faithful to my model. Some things I want to change however are the size and placement of the trees and other fauna. I will also experiment with different sizes of "Parks", changing the scale of the trees and other fauna can utilise a small platform a lot more efficiently and with a decent look to it, however a larger platform will always provide more space to work with, but will not be accurate to the AR room projection I hope to achieve. There will be a lot of experimentation with the size of objects

Another short week with no code currently being worked on. I hope the upcoming classes will have a little more to do about syntax and functions in Processing as it's still a subject I need to understand properly. Over the next couple of weeks I'm looking to ramp up the amount of coding I'm doing outside of university and at home, I've made plans with my computer science friend to begin looking at some code for a working example of a 2D recursive tree he has written himself. Using his comments and overall knowledge about java and programming I hope to learn a lot more about fractals and generating them, and how I generate several at a time to create a park environment.
