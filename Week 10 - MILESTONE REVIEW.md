# Slave to the Algorithm - MILESTONE REVIEW

Eamon Saunders S3663147

__*Milestone Week*__

Milestone week has finally come, my report will be written first on my github, and then will be redesigned to a pdf in InDesign.

**Concept**

My concept hasn't changed a whole lot since my presentation. I am still making a "random park generator" that will be at least displayed on a computer screen through simple graphics and 3D shapes such as boxes. My stretched goal that I mentioned during the pitch presentation was to have these trees then displayed in some AR like form, or even project it into a screen wall room. However with the due date rapidly approaching, the goal I have set is to keep working on the computer graphics side of the park generation. I will definitely finish the overall park generator, however adding in complex display methods or other interactive elements to my design only increases the complexity and will make it challenging to finish the scope of my project by the due date. Because of this I have decided to worry about display methods after I have my final park generator, and only to worry about the design of the computer scale "park generator".

The digital concept of my project also hasn't changed much, I now have trees that can randomly spawn on a button press around my canvas, they also stay on the canvas and begin to form a thick forest if I continue to let them spawn. I still want to further the actual park objects by including park benches and pathways that are generated at the same time as the trees. This will be the next couple of changes to my code, to do this I will need to design a couple of variations of park benches, which I will do by utilising the translate, push and pop matrix, and box functions. I will then utilise the same code that randomly chooses a point for the root and leaves to spawn, and use that to make the benches spawn along a random spot on the x or z axis, however not both as I want the park benches to stay in a straight line as if they have been planned by a city planner. If I have the time I will also create random bushes, which shouldn't be too hard as I will only need to manipulate the tree class a little bit to grow closer to the ground, making a random clump of vine like shapes but on the ground like a bush. Another addition could be lights in the park, that have light properties and help light the park, however the design could take some time, and working with lighting will be a whole new topic I would have to approach.

**Planning**

Some planning will have to take place so that I can finish what I stil have planned. The first thing I plan to do is to add a park bench class as well into my project, as well as create a more "forest" like spawn system for the trees. The trees will have to spawn in groupings that take the form of what you might see at an actual park. So I will have to do some research into different park layouts and how far apart general tree placement is in parks. This will all take place before WEEK 11's in class session. After this I will add in the pathways, and make sure that when you have pressed a key on your keyboard, that an actual park generation is taking place, not just singular objects. This will be the goal of WEEK 12. Finally WEEK 13's goal will be to make sure that my project is creating interesting and unique park generations. As this is the final week of work, I expect this week to be rather rushed and busy, however I will definitely be bringing in a project that creates random parks, and has interesting and unique objects that I will have fully finished and fleshed out by the time of WEEK 13 class.

**Tools & Resources**

Some of the resources I will be heavily abusing are: The Coding Train videos and projects, as well as my computer science friend's knowledge on coding. There are still a lot of videos that have content I feel could be related to my random park generator, so I will continue to look through the coding train's youtube videos and make manipulations to the code he provides. My computer science friend as well will be one of the most useful resources I have. I can not only use him as an active code debugger, but he also helps make sure I'm coding in an efficient way, utilising the code that has already been written by Daniel, making it so that overall my understanding is better with the code I'm working with and coding in general.

I will also make sure to talk to some of the other students in class, not only to help with anyone that might be stuck, but also when my code might need a bit of pushing. With such creative people working in such a close vicinity, the ideas and brainstorming is endless. The amount of times someone in class has suggested a certain improvement that would make my project look much better has been countless, using my peers as inspiration has helped improve how simple and effective my project is.
