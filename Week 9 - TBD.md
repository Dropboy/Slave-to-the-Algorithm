# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 9

__*Class TBD*__

-Started by using a sensor we had no idea what was, had to find what it did and what it's used for
  -Tried to make a hand clap sensor, failed horribly multiple times
  -Got it to work but only worked off of tapping, the microphone seemeed to be too sensitive, also played with sensitivity nozzle on the top
-Helped Emily with her sound, was not able to get it to work but it ended up being a problem with syntax
