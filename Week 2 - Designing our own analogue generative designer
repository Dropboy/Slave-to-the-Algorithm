# Slave to the Algorithm
**Week 2**

*Designing a generative design machine and further Processing skills/Symphony of Failure*

For Week 2 we started the session with a more analogue challenge, use cardboard and other random objects Karen had brought us to create a "machine" that would generate its own designs. This machine was tasked with creating the designs through any other input than human interaction, which was the real challenge of this activity. I was away getting cardboard during the ideation of our machine however when I returned the team was already deep into the possible construction of our machine.

The initial idea was to use the vibrations of each of our mobile phones to make a box vibrate so that it would use pens that would be attached to the bottom to draw onto a piece of butchers paper below it. This idea went through a couple of different prototypes, all unfortunately did not generate any design without some sort of human interaction. We hung the box from the rafters of the top of the ceiling, as well as hung the pens from the bottom of the box, in hopes the swing of the twine would help generate more movement from the vibration, hence having a bit of a crazier style to the generated design, however it effectively did nothing, the vibration of the phone motors was too weak and would not carry through the cardboard box.
