# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 6

__*Logotype and presentations*__

Walking into week 6 was very nerve wracking, with the thought of a presentation looming over our heads, everyone was in a bit of a frantic state. However to start the lesson we drew up 4 similar "logotypes" as a logo of sorts to use for mapping all of the projects different attributes on a large piece of paper. This was a very fun and interesting way for Karen to remove some of the stress of presenting, as well as give us a physical way of mapping all of the projects into somewhat similar categories.

Many of the presentations were so well thought out and researched, every idea you could see being used in some interesting and out of the ordinary way, making all of the projects very inspiring to understand and question. What would be very interesting as well, would be to see what ideas could possibly be joined together to create a very large and grand project. For example, utilising some of my random generation and maybe someone doing some facial recognition, to create randomly generating face filters would be very interesting and have many varied results.

Whilst listening to the presentations we were tasked with making a logotype map that mapped a certain function of the projects, ours was the input of our projects. We mapped the inputs with a simple Boolean choice, human or robot. We found some projects required more of a human input rather than a set measurement or parameter, so we grouped them accordingly. We began to see patterns form from the placements of all the logotype, you began to see that some of the projects were
