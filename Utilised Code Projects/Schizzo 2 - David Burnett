This was the original sketch that spurred my idea for a randomly generated "urban designer". Originally I wanted to replicate this fake 3D look by illustrating the park elements like David has here. However once I started looking at Daniel's fractal videos and his different recursive algorithm's for tree formations, I decided I wanted to see how far I could take it in 3D before conceding to fake 3D.
