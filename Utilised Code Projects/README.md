This is where all of the projects that I will manipulate and edit are kept. Each project will have it's own folder and will be their original source code, so that you can see where I have pulled inspiration and parts of the final project code from. I will also try to have a journal post with the same name for each project, that will describe how I have or might use it, as well as what I have learnt from looking and using the code. All projects should be authored within the code.
