# Slave to the Algorithm
**Week 1**

*Introduction to Processing and generative/parametric design*

With the first week of University starting, we dove right into some coding with the IDE, Processing. Processing being a lightweight open-source graphical library, I found it easier than some of the other IDE's I've ever started with, fairly good UX and very simple to follow. Through the class we explored various basic graphic commands and the syntax that we would have to strictly adhere to.

We started by experimenting with lines, other shapes and their strokes, and how you could visualise them with the commands: Line, Ellipse, Rect, and Stroke. Depending on the position as well based off of their coordinates (x1,x2,y1,y2, the x being the two x coordinates it will span to, and same with the y)
