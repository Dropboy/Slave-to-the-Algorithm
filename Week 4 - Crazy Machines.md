# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 4

__*Crazy machines and Jedi Mastering*__

*Started by thinking of a "crazy machine" ours was a machine that generated a spotify playlist depending on how sad you are*

We started off the class by brainstorming ideas of "Crazy machines" that would take some sort of human interaction and generate something from that, my groups idea was to generate a playlist depending on how sad or happy you are, which is recorded off of a screenshot. After your mood is measured, it will generate a 10 song playlist from some of your music, and selected songs that match the type of mood your in. This will be delivered by a QR code you can scan that will take you to a created Spotify playlist.

*Also played around with a hacked "jedi mind tester"*

Another thing that peaked my interest was a hacked jedi mind teste that was able to read how meditated or concentrated you were, this was an interesting experiment to look at, as the 3 plates that were built into the toy were able to measure this quite accurately off of just galvanic skin cells. When I closed my eyes and tried to best meditate, as soon as I opened them the meditation tab would be to the top as my attention would be quite low, however when Karen came and snapped her fingers the attention tab began to rise again. It would be interesting to see how else you could use these two values, perhaps a small game that generates an image of something relaxing while you have more relaxing thoughts or vice versa a more focused image of someone studying. They could also be used to generate random images themselves, which would create it's own unique look.

*Showed some stuff in relation to data visualisation*

*Expanded my ideas slighlty for final project*
