# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 4

__*Crazy machines and Jedi Mastering*__

We started off the class by brainstorming ideas of "Crazy machines" that would take some sort of human interaction and generate something from that, my groups idea was to generate a playlist depending on how sad or happy you are, which is recorded off of a screenshot. After your mood is measured, it will generate a 10 song playlist from some of your music, and selected songs that match the type of mood your in. This will be delivered by a QR code you can scan that will take you to a created Spotify playlist. From this we learnt about MoSCoW, or: M(ust) S(hould) C(ould) W(on't). Using MoSCoW we were able to see what must happen with our machine, such as, it must have facial recognition, playlist generation, and in an app or mall like vending machine. It should pull from your own music as well as spotify's radio algorithm. It could let you choose your preferences of what genre or time zone, or add on to a mental wellness app that would be able to track how you've been feeling that week, and show you whether the playlists have been helping. I plan on using MoSCoW for my project, so I can see the features I know I want to focus on, such as the random generation of plants and the drawing of this.

Closer to the end of the session I had a quick chat with Karen about the state of my project pitch. From the start of our studio I've been quite certain as to wanting to generate some sort of urban landscape, a park helps solve the problem of requiring more greenery and fauna in and around city-scapes, especially larger cities such as Shanghai, where nature is a rare sight. There's a couple ways you can expand on the simple idea of a park generation sketch: for example, if you were to add a method where, the park that is generated is based off of a webcam capturing the room's dimensions, this would help solve the problem of finding smaller spots for "relaxation" or garden areas, a big problem I have found in modern city planning.

Another thing that peaked my interest was a hacked jedi mind tester that was able to read how meditated or concentrated you were, this was an interesting experiment to tinker with, as the 3 plates that were built into the toy were able to measure this quite accurately off of just galvanic skin cells. When I closed my eyes and tried to best meditate, as soon as I opened my eyes the meditation tab would be at the top, and my attention would be quite low. When Karen came and snapped her fingers the attention tab began to rise again however. It would be interesting to see how else you could use these two values, perhaps a small game that generates an image of something relaxing while you have more relaxing thoughts or vice versa a more focused image of someone studying. They could also be used to generate random images themselves, which could create it's own unique look.

*Showed some stuff in relation to data visualisation*
