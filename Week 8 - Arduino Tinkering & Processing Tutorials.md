# Slave to the Algorithm - Week 8

__*Arduino Tinkering & Processing Tutorials*__

-Started the class looking at Arduino
  -Made ultrasonic sensor that can tell how far away something is in front of it
  -Then used the values that the Arduino was able to generate to make a processing sketch that made an image bigger the further away you are from the image
  -Then altered it to be a circle that grew bigger and react to mouse movement rather than the sensor
